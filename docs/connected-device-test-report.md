# Connected physical-device test report

Report date: 22 July 2026

This report records tests that were actually executed on the connected physical device. It does not treat unrun model packs or performance profiles as passing.

## Reference device

- Manufacturer/model: Samsung SM-F966B
- Android: 16, API 36
- ABI/SoC: arm64-v8a, SM8750
- RAM class: approximately 11.4 GB
- Device serial: masked
- Distribution tested: `consumerDebug`
- Inference backend observed: LiteRT-LM 0.14.0, GPU

## Latest real-model acceptance

The app-managed Settings workflow downloaded and activated Gemma 4 E2B in app-private storage. The active artifact was independently checked with `run-as`:

- Size: 2,583,085,056 bytes
- SHA-256: `ab7838cdfc8f77e54d8ca45eadceb20452d9f01e4bfade03e5dce27911b27e42`
- Source revision: `7fa1d78473894f7e736a21d920c3aa80f950c0db`
- Multimodal: yes

Direct instrumentation was used instead of Gradle's uninstalling connected-test lifecycle, preserving the app-private model pack.

| Suite | Result | Time | Evidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Real E2B planner, English/Hindi/Hinglish | PASS, 1 test | 59.486 s | Valid typed plans, GPU, no fixture fallback; one bounded repair per case |
| Real E2B visual verifier | PASS, 1 test | 11.764 s | One accepted candidate, three evidence conditions, no repair |
| Real E2B grounded answer/no-answer | PASS, 2 tests | 5.940 s | Two valid evidence references; no-answer bypassed Gemma |

After the run, thermal status remained 0 and the bounded log window contained no target-app fatal exception, ANR, OOM, or native fatal signal.

## Other demonstrated connected gates

- ConsumerDebug build/install and deterministic Compose UI flow.
- Safe, run-specific MediaStore seed/import/cleanup with zero remaining test items.
- Resumable Room indexing and legacy schema migration.
- Event query plus two result-set-aware follow-ups.
- On-device video keyframe extraction, timestamp evidence, and playback-at-match.
- Consumer network component audit and offlineDemo manifest without Internet permission.

Detailed commands, run IDs, failures, cleanup counts, and artifact paths are recorded chronologically in `docs/implementation-status.md`.

## Current limitations and honest skips

- E4B: NOT RUN. It is optional; no verified E4B pack is installed.
- SigLIP2 q8 retrieval pack: INSTALLED and both ONNX towers executed, but semantic acceptance FAILED. The red-query fixture scored the blue image 0.06414 versus red 0.06094. Recall@K, threshold calibration, and 5k/20k gates remain pending.
- Full release acceptance and universal performance claims: NOT CLAIMED.
- The planner needed its permitted repair call for all three language fixtures; first-pass structured output remains an optimization target.

## Artifacts

- `artifacts/device-runs/phase6_e2b_restore_20260722/`
- `artifacts/device-runs/phase4_siglip2_q8_20260722/`
- `artifacts/device-runs/phase8_video_direct2_20260722/`
- `artifacts/device-runs/phase8_events_exif_20260722/`
- `artifacts/device-runs/phase9_network_privacy_20260722/`

Generated artifacts may be excluded from Git because they include bulky logs, screenshots, and device-run outputs. The repository-tracked status report preserves their paths and summarized results.
